# Cha-Chess

This is a fun project to play with the T3 stack and websockets via pusher.

Playing with lego, and using libraries and third parties for everythin. Down the road, maybe we will replace bits and pieces with our home grown implementations (e.g. board representation, chess rules, board UI, some basic AI)
## TODO

- [] there is an issue with promotion <https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/issues/293>

- [] `react-chessboard` uses `dnd-core` which is pretty meh --> rebuild board using `dnd-kit`
